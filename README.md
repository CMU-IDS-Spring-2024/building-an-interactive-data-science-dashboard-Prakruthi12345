In this assignment, you will adopt the persona of being a data scientist for Allegheny County’s Health Department.  Your goal is to build data science tools to make it easier for the health department to understand trends of an ongoing health crisis:  fatal accidental overdoses from a variety of drugs in the county.  The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center publishes a monthly dataset that describes fatal accidental overdose incidents in Allegheny County, denoting age, gender, race, drugs present, zip code of incident and zip code of residence.

This data, downloaded as of September 22, 2023, is located in [data/overdose_data_092223.csv](data/overdose_data_092223.csv)

Through a series of assignments, you will build out a dashboard to support the interactive exploration and analysis of the dataset.  You will use this same repository for Assignments 3a, 3b, and 3c.  

- [ ] For Assignment 3a, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/1_👥_Demographics.py`
- [ ] For Assignment 3b, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/2_📈_Trends.py`
- [ ] For Assignment 3c, Update the provided Streamlit python file, `pages/3_🌍_Map.py`
- [ ] In addition, submit your Github repository URL on Canvas for each of the three assignments.

## Running the Streamlit app

You can execute the Streamlit app by running `streamlit run County_Dashboard.py`

## Questions 

1. Did you notice any interesting patterns or trends in the dataset?

   
2. Was it possible to understand how the dataset was different in the earlier years versus the more recent years?
   
  1. If so, what were some differences?  
  2. If not, how would you suggest changing the dashboard to make differences easier to find?


3. Did you discover any filters that demonstrated big differences from the overall dataset among the demographics (such as age, race, or gender)?

   
4. Are there any other features you wish were present in your dashboard to either make discovery easier or to explore alternative aspects of the dataset?
